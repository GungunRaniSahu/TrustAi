TrustAI Advisor – Simple Technical Documentation
Problem Statement
Today, many people shop online — but not all websites are safe. Some fake websites look real and attractive by:

Showing huge discounts like "90% OFF!"

Adding fake customer reviews

Hiding real contact or refund details

Using scammy payment methods

and not being honest to their job 

People often fall for these tricks and lose money or personal info. We needed a smart solution to check if a website is trustworthy before ordering.

Our Solution: TrustAI Advisor
TrustAI Advisor is a tool that uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) to analyze any shopping website and tells users:

Whether the website is safe for online shopping

What things look good (trust points)

What things are suspicious (red flags)

It gives a human-like summary in simple words to help users decide:
"Is this website trustworthy or risky?"

AI Model and Tools Used
We used OpenAI’s GPT-4o model to do the trust analysis.

Tech Stack
Technology | Purpose
HTML + CSS | For the structure and styling of web-based components
JavaScript | For adding dynamic behavior to the webpage
Node.js    | Server-side JavaScript to run logic
Express.js | To handle routing and API endpoints
Python     | For additional analysis (e.g., review or sentiment detection, future AI plans)
OpenAI     | The brain of the system – it evaluates and writes trust summaries
Cheerio.js | To extract data from website HTML files
FS Module  | To read saved website HTML from local files

 Tools & Libraries:

Tool/Library	Purpose
1.openai	     To connect with GPT-4o (AI brain)
2.cheerio	     To read and extract content from website HTML
3.fs	         To load the HTML file from your system
4.requests       To retrive or scrape the HTML content of the website
5.beautifulsoup  To clean the scrraped HTML data 

 How AI Helps:
We send important website content (like reviews, refund policies, etc.) to GPT-4o. 
GPT-4o checks for good and bad signs and replies with a summary.
We ask it to give a simple YES/NO-style recommendation + suggestions.

 How the System Works
Here's the full step-by-step process:

 You save the HTML of any shopping website you want to check.
 Our code opens this HTML file.
 It uses cheerio to look for useful things like:

Customer reviews , Contact details , Refund or return policies , Trust badges (like SSL Secure) , Social media links

 The extracted content is sent to GPT-4 through the OpenAI API.
 GPT-4o replies with a summary: “This site looks safe,” or “Please research more before trusting this site.”

 The summary is printed for the user to read.

 Future Improvements
Here’s how we can make TrustAI Advisor better:

Live Site Checker – Instead of uploading HTML, fetch website data automatically.

Browser Extension – A Chrome extension that shows trust results while browsing.

Trust Score – Add a number (e.g., 8/10 safe) to help users decide quickly.

Multi-language Support – Give output in Hindi, Bengali, etc. for wider reach.

Report Button – Let users report fake sites to build a safe shopping database.

Fake Review Detection – Analyze patterns to catch copied or AI-generated reviews.

 Summary (Why It’s Useful)
Saves users from fake online stores.

Uses smart AI to give easy answers.

Can be turned into a Chrome extension later.

Helps Indian users (especially in Tier-2, Tier-3 cities) trust COD sites.
