🛡️ TrustAI Advisor – Simple Technical Documentation
📌 Problem Statement
Today, many people shop online — but not all websites are safe. Some fake websites look real and attractive by:

Showing huge discounts like "90% OFF!"

Adding fake customer reviews

Hiding real contact or refund details

Using scammy payment methods

People often fall for these tricks and lose money or personal info. We needed a smart solution to check if a website is trustworthy before ordering.

💡 Our Solution: TrustAI Advisor
TrustAI Advisor is a tool that uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) to analyze any shopping website and tells users:

Whether the website is safe for online shopping

What things look good (trust points)

What things are suspicious (red flags)

It gives a human-like summary in simple words to help users decide:
"Is this website trustworthy or risky?"

🧠 AI Model and Tools Used
We used OpenAI’s GPT-4 model to do the trust analysis.

🔧 Tools & Libraries:

Tool/Library	Purpose
openai	To connect with GPT-4 (AI brain)
cheerio	To read and extract content from website HTML
fs	To load the HTML file from your system
👩‍💻 How AI Helps:
We send important website content (like reviews, refund policies, etc.) to GPT-4.

GPT-4 checks for good and bad signs and replies with a summary.

We ask it to give a simple YES/NO-style recommendation + suggestions.

⚙️ How the System Works
Here's the full step-by-step process:

💻 You save the HTML of any shopping website you want to check.

📄 Our code opens this HTML file.

🕵️ It uses cheerio to look for useful things like:

Customer reviews

Contact details

Refund or return policies

Trust badges (like SSL Secure)

Social media links

📬 The extracted content is sent to GPT-4 through the OpenAI API.

🧠 GPT-4 replies with a summary: “This site looks safe,” or “Please research more before trusting this site.”

✅ The summary is printed for the user to read.

🌱 Future Improvements
Here’s how we can make TrustAI Advisor better:

Live Site Checker – Instead of uploading HTML, fetch website data automatically.

Browser Extension – A Chrome extension that shows trust results while browsing.

Trust Score – Add a number (e.g., 8/10 safe) to help users decide quickly.

Multi-language Support – Give output in Hindi, Bengali, etc. for wider reach.

Report Button – Let users report fake sites to build a safe shopping database.

Fake Review Detection – Analyze patterns to catch copied or AI-generated reviews.

✅ Summary (Why It’s Useful)
Saves users from fake online stores.

Uses smart AI to give easy answers.

Can be turned into a Chrome extension later.
